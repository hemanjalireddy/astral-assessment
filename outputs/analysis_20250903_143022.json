Use ScrapFly to bypass LinkedIn's anti-bot measures\n2. Extract raw HTML\n3. Process with GPT-4 to structure the data\n\n**Pros**: More flexible, can adapt to LinkedIn changes\n**Cons**: Higher complexity, potential reliability issues\n\n### Option 3: PhantomBuster + Zapier Integration\n**Service**: https://phantombuster.com/\n**Use Case**: For bulk processing and CRM integration\n**Pros**: Great for workflow automation\n**Cons**: Overkill for single profile extraction\n\n## Recommended Implementation\nFor the astral use case, **Proxycurl** is the optimal choice because:\n\n1. **Reliability**: Purpose-built for LinkedIn extraction\n2. **Compliance**: Handles legal considerations \n3. **Cost**: Very affordable at scale\n4. **Speed**: Real-time extraction vs batch processing\n5. **Accuracy**: Structured data format perfect for AI processing\n\n## Integration Architecture\n```\nLinkedIn URL → Proxycurl API → Structured Data → AI Enhancement → Profile Insights\n```\n\n## Cost Analysis\n- Proxycurl: $0.001 per profile\n- Expected volume: 1000 profiles/month = $1/month\n- ROI: High-quality lead intelligence worth 1000x the extraction cost\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n- Research and setup: 2 hours\n- API integration: 1 hour  \n- Testing and validation: 1 hour\n- Total: 4 hours\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n- Backup with ScrapFly approach if Proxycurl changes pricing\n- Cache results to minimize API calls\n- Implement graceful degradation if service is unavailable\n\nThis approach aligns with astral's principle: \"a feature we don't have to build is better than one we do build\"\n"

Once edited, an indicator will note that edits were made. Todo-lists inside comments have also received the ability to be ticked off after the comment has been submitted.\n\nThe timestamps on comments and other issue history entries are now links, so you'll be able to share a direct link to a specific comment.\n\n## [Invite your team⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-10-14-improved-comments\\#invite-your-team)\n\nInviting your team is now easier with dedicated invite links. To grab your personal share link, head to [People](https://linear.app/settings/people/invite) tab under settings. As always, you'll also be able to invite your team via email.\n\n## [Link to issues in GitHub⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-10-14-improved-comments\\#link-to-issues-in-github)\n\nWhile not a new feature of Linear, we thought it would be worth mentioning that GitHub has added the ability to auto-link issue ID's with external issue trackers. This works well together with Linear, and you'll be able to set it up under repository settings for each team. Just map your team key (e.g. `KEY-`) to the Linear URL ( `https://linear.app/issue/KEY-<num>`). Don't forget to replace the team key with yours.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes:⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-10-14-improved-comments\\#other-improvements-and-fixes:)\n\n- Multiple GitHub pull requests are now combined into a single indicator on lists and boards which makes it easier to open the correct PR through the command menu\n- Clearing search input doesn't open the search page anymore\n- Search results can now be filtered by team\n- Selecting issue filters in the issue detail pane now includes the ability to create and assign a new label if one isn't found\n- Archiving issues from a board lane now respect any active filters you might have going on\n- Several fixes to keyboard navigation under projects\n- Opening an issue will now mark all notifications for that issue as read\n- Action to clear Inbox has been renamed as \"clear all notifications\"\n- Board views now include full issue titles\n- Team and label names are now unique\n- The cycle menu now uses the command menu and includes an action to favorite the cycle\n- The feedback form now caches the message locally so that you don't lose text upon accidental close\n- Typed in arrows in descriptions and comments now get converted into Unicode characters\n- Improvements to the data synchronization protocol\n- Fix to fetching Figma previews under certain conditions\n- Fixes ordering of issues in the board view\n- Fixes ordering of workflow statuses",
      "https://linear.app/changelog/page/21": "[Skip to content →](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21#skip-nav)\n\n# Changelog\n\nSearch… `⌘K`\n\nJuly 29, 2019\n\n[**Projects**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-07-28-projects)\n\n## [Projects⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#projects)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/cef63233962b8807edd6a758914579aadee01d94-1454x577.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nTo set direction and long term goals for the team it is often useful to plan larger initiatives or features alongside all the other work that needs to happen.\n\nWith **Linear Projects**, we wanted to make exceptionally easy and fast to create a project, and start refining it as you go. You can optionally set a target date, description, and link to the product spec so that the necessary context is there.\n\nYou can break the individual work to multiple Cycles, and make constant progress each week to complete the project.\n\nThis is our first release of Projects and we're excited to continue expanding them to make it easier for you to design and build software.\n\n**ProTip:** If you need to group issues but they are too small to use Projects, you can link them together as sub-issues. Select an issue, and from command menu pick _Set parent issue_.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Archived issues can now be accessed via their URL and no longer return a 404\n- Scroll lists with `Ctrl`  `n` and `Ctrl`  `p` shortcuts\n- Issues are now deselected in multi-select when changing views.\n- Hovering over sub-issues now support keyboard shortcuts\n- Improved editor styles\n- Improved styling for All Cycles view\n- Improved messaging for git branch name copying\n- Better error handling for failed user actions\n- Optimized initial application data loading performance\n- Don't trigger issue peek in inputs (tip: show issue peek by pressing `Option` in lists)\n- Fixed setting parent issue when creating a new sub-issue in some views\n- Fixed duplicate linking with GitHub pull requests\n- Fixed command menu mouse focus and styling for Safari\n\nJuly 19, 2019\n\n[**Cycles are here!**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-07-18-cycles-are-here)\n\n## [Cycles are here!⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#cycles-are-here!)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/73b1c27b9015ed7c49eb971644cf89b524062f5d-1400x666.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nCycles are no longer a developer preview feature and are available to every team. We've added a neat side-bar to the cycle view ( `Command/Ctrl`  `i`) that gives you a great overview of the cycle. It helps you figure out where you're at in the cycle and what the workload for each of your team-members looks like.\n\nYou can enable cycles in your [team settings](https://linear.app/settings/teams)\n\n## [Email notification improvements⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#email-notification-improvements)\n\nLinear was a bit too eager to send emails on unread notifications. We've tweaked the delays to be based on the urgency of the notification.\n\n- Unread urgent notifications are delivered via email after **30 seconds**\n- Unread mention notifications are sent after **5 minutes**\n- Unread issue assignment notifications are sent after **1 hour**\n- Unread comment notifications on issues that you subscribe to are sent after **1 hour**\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Comments now have a submit button. If you still prefer to submit via the keyboard, `Command/Ctrl`  `Enter` is there to help you\n- The list group rows received a small + button that lets you quickly create a new issue for that workflow state\n- The action menu has new colors in dark mode\n- A toast is now displayed when saving team settings\n- Added \"Remove from cycle\" command\n- The issue's back button now works the same as hitting `Esc`\n- Cycles and projects are now automatically removed from issues that are moved to another team\n- Fixes to some rendering issues with the cycle burn-up chart\n- Fixes a problem where the action menu would not always show up when pressing `Command/Ctrl`  `k`\n\nJuly 12, 2019\n\n[**GitHub workflow configuration**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-07-11-github-workflow-configuration)\n\n## [GitHub workflow configuration⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#github-workflow-configuration)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/37bd5f017b6b71dee4bdb71bc9adc5a96acd8c74-2708x1296.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nGitHub integration is one of our time-saving features in Linear. It lets Linear manage the status of issues based on associated GitHub pull requests. Previously, if you had the integration enabled, a pull request would automatically move associated issues into the _In Progress_ status once the PR has been opened, and into the _Completed_ status upon PR merge.\n\nWe wanted to give teams more control over their workflows and now you can customize the automation by setting your own workflow status for PR open and merge events. For example, to separate issues waiting for a code review, create a _In Review_ status for your team and associate PR open to trigger this status. You can also omit the automation for each step and configure automation for each team separately.\n\nWe also improved how multiple pull requests per issue are treated. If your issue has several open pull requests open, we'll wait for all of them being merged until we trigger the merge automation step.\n\n## [Cycle improvements⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#cycle-improvements)\n\nCycles are still under active development and available under _Developer Preview_ option in your personal settings. This week we shipped several cycle improvements:\n\n- Weekends are now drawn to estimation chart, and also taken into account with estimation calculations\n- Several fixes to cycle progress calculation and drawing\n- Issues are associated with the cycle if the issue is created from the cycle view\n- When enabling cycles an active cycle is created instead of having to wait a week for the planned cycle to start\n- Issues in _My Issues_ are grouped by cycle and ordered by cycle start date\n- Improvements to keyboard shortcuts when adding issues into cycles\n- Fixed workflow ordering on cycle views\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Better dark mode color scheme and other style tweaks\n- @mentions and links are now more visible in comments and issue descriptions\n- Added links to toast messages when moving issues between views for easier navigation\n- Move visible default label colors and styling in lists\n- Added issue filtering options for priority and labels\n- Bulk actions for issues are now shown in more views if they share the same team\n- Fixes to toast messages when inviting new teammates\n- Fixed issue with keyboard shortcuts not always working in the issue view\n- Several fixes to action menu\n- Fixed issue saving when image upload is still in progress\n\nJuly 5, 2019\n\n[**Cycles**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-07-04-cycles)\n\n## [Cycles⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#cycles)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/51b5690009719d059be964ac208a56e89ad96901-1400x666.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nYou might know them as sprints, but we decided to call them cycles to give them meaning outside of the agile methodology. Whether you work in agile ways or not, cycles provide a great way of planning and measuring iterative development cycles. Take some time each week (or weeks, depending on how long you configure your cycle to be) to plan what your team is supposed to work on next, then let Linear measure how you're executing towards that goal.\n\nYou can enable cycles in your [team settings](https://linear.app/linear.app/settings/teams), but need to first opt-in to see **Developer preview** in your [preferences](https://linear.app/linear.app/settings/preferences). You'll choose how long each cycle is and what day of the week they start and Linear takes care of the rest. Cycles are automatically created and closed based on the selected schedule and any unfinished work in each cycle will automatically be moved to the next cycle.\n\n## [Estimation⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#estimation)\n\nYou can now opt in to show time estimates for your issues. Estimation complements cycles and lets your team communicate the complexity of each issue.\n\nTurn on estimates in the [team settings](https://linear.app/linear.app/settings/teams). You can choose between a number of ways to estimate issues. Use a linear scale, exponential scale, Fibonacci scale, or use T-Shirt sizes to describe the complexity of each issue. Regardless of what scale you choose, cycles will automatically compute the overall effort required to complete the cycle and update its graphs accordingly.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Added action to set estimates: `Shift`  `e`\n- Added actions to assign the cycle of an issue: `Shift`  `c`\n- Added an action to assign an issue to the active cycle: `Shift`  `Command/Ctrl`  `c`\n- The issue lists will show the estimate and cycle of each issue\n- Issues are automatically moved out of the backlog when added to a cycle\n- Issues are automatically removed from a cycle if move back to the backlog\n- Added toasts when you move issues between active and the backlog so that issues just don't disappear on you\n\nJune 28, 2019\n\n[**Backlog and Active Issues**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-06-27-backlog-and-active-issues)\n\n## [Backlog and Active Issues⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#backlog-and-active-issues)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/892799b0f295e3db3041bf3f254d141f16894407-1840x1076.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nManaging a large number of issues can be challenging if you keep them in one place. We added Backlog as the place for new issues and ideas. These are issues that have yet to be prioritized and put on your team's roadmap. Backlog will show up in the sidebar along with other issue categories. By default you'll have one backlog workflow status but you can add more of them in team settings.\n\nWhen your team is ready to work on issues in Backlog, move them into Active Issues. To make easy to move issues between Backlog and Active Issues, two new shortcuts are available:\n\n- Move to Active Issues: `Command/Ctrl`  `Shift`  `a`\n- Move to Backlog : `Command/Ctrl`  `Shift`  `b`\n\n## [Select All & bulk actions toolbar⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#select-all-and-bulk-actions-toolbar)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/4d977ddeb42a6dab48a6b60e2195815c49cc86b3-1333x811.gif?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nWe added \"Select All\" check-boxes for each issue group which will select all issues in the group. You can (de)select individual issues by un-checking or by pressing `x` shortcut.\n\nAfter selecting a group of issues, a new bulk action toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen to make it easier to perform common actions.\n\nPro tip: Did you know you can also select ranges with `Shift` \\+ click?\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Changed \"Copy git branch\" shortcut into `Command/Ctrl`  `Shift` `.` to support Windows\n- Fixed archiving issue workflow states\n- Fixed opening pull requests in the desktop application\n- Improved search for certain actions in the command menu\n\nJune 21, 2019\n\n[**International keyboard shortcut improvements**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-06-20-international-keyboard-shortcut-improvements)\n\n## [International keyboard shortcut improvements⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#international-keyboard-shortcut-improvements)\n\nKeyboard shortcuts have been improved for non-US keyboard layouts. As part of the improvements, a few shortcuts were remapped to different shortcuts:\n\n- Copy issue ID: `Command/Ctrl` `.`\n- Copy issue git branch: `Command/Ctrl`  `Shift` `.`\n\n## [New version for Linear desktop application⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#new-version-for-linear-desktop-application)\n\nAs part of macOS 10.14.5 Apple tightened security requirements for applications. New version of the Linear desktop app has been notarized to match the requirements. If you had issues running the application before, please download the new version here: [https://linear.app/download](https://linear.app/download)\n\n## [Improved issue details bar⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#improved-issue-details-bar)\n\nThe UI is simplified and the drop-downs are replaced with the command menu actions.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Comment text is now included in desktop notifications\n- Rename issues from the command menu\n- Ability to copy url to the team. You can find it in the more menu by the team\n- Fix to `Command/Ctrl`  `Enter` / `Escape` outside editor\n- Fix to back button behavior in issue compose\n- Removed showing of duplicate toasts\n- Removed empty grouping headers\n\nMay 27, 2019\n\n[**Grouping headers**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-05-26-grouping-headers)\n\n## [Grouping headers⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#grouping-headers)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/d77a7a14a1e72e45fac356b43916571e686ba9c3-1400x666.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nThe open and closed issue views received UI improvements in the form of grouping headers. While issues have always been sorted primarily based on their workflow status, the new headers make this a lot more clear.\n\n## [Timezone⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#timezone)\n\nIn settings, teams can now define which timezone most of their people are working from. This setting doesn't affect much yet but will be important once you can, for example, define what day of the week a sprint should start on.\n\nOn that note, don't expect too many updates in the next few weeks as we're working hard behind the scenes to build out support for our next big features: Backlogs, sprints, and projects.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Added some missing tooltips to the sidebar\n- Issue lists have better performance\n- Editing the issue title no longer has cursor problems\n- Check-boxes for issues in the list view have a larger click-area\n- Fixed exceptions when looking at issues that are over a year old\n- Cleaned up the layout of forms in settings\n- Updated icon buttons to be more consistent across the application\n- Pressing down the command or shift keys after having changed the selection via the keyboard on Safari no longer resets the selection.\n\nMay 20, 2019\n\n[**New sidebar design**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-05-19-new-sidebar-design)\n\n## [New sidebar design⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#new-sidebar-design)\n\nWe re-designed the sidebar to be more compact and scalable for upcoming features. It now shows more information and teams are sectioned better. Under each team, you can find their issues grouped into open and closed views. You'll also have the ability to see all issues in a list in addition to the existing board view.\n\nTogether with the sidebar, we improved headers for better navigation and issue counts. We also added issue filters to all list views so it's easier to drill down issues based on different parameters.\n\n## [Copy issue ID and git branch name⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#copy-issue-id-and-git-branch-name)\n\nTo make it faster to copy the issue ID or suggested git branch name, we added icons to the issue view sidebar for them. You'll still be able to get them through the action menu but this change should make copying easier for users who prefer to use a mouse.\n\n## [Other improvements and fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Unified view components for different lists\n- App icon for iOS devices when saved to the home screen\n- Improved Slack notifications\n- New view for editing issue states\n\nMay 10, 2019\n\n[**First-time user experience**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-05-09-first-time-user-experience)\n\n## [First-time user experience⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#first-time-user-experience)\n\n![](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f3e6ad82210f6a80be6ea39757418c9e267e5503-1419x878.jpg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\nThis week we made major improvements to the sign in and first-time user experience: everyone in your team will now get an introduction to the command menu and other Linear features.\n\nIf you are an existing user, you can initiate first-time introduction through the command menu by searching for \"welcome tutorial.\"\n\n## [Keyboard shortcuts⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#keyboard-shortcuts)\n\nRedesigned the keyboard shortcuts page with a new design and added all the supported shortcuts. Hit `?` to bring up the keyboard shortcuts.\n\n## [Emoji autocomplete⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#emoji-autocomplete)\n\nTyping `:` in any of the issue descriptions or comments now brings up the emoji autocomplete.\n\n## [Slack /linear command⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#slack-linear-command)\n\nIn addition to the \"More actions\" message action, you can now open the new issue dialog with `/linear` command to file new issues quickly from Slack.\n\n## [Loading state⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#loading-state)\n\nWhile we don't like seeing loading states in the app, having one for the initial load and browser refresh is necessary. We improved design with a subtle logo animation.\n\n## [Other improvements & fixes⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#other-improvements-and-fixes)\n\n- Updated favicon\n- Fixed bugs in GitHub integration and removed source code access from permissions\n- Fixed keyboard navigation in Inbox\n- Fixed sub-issue actions to focus on the correct sub-issue\n- Moved add team functionality to settings page\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\n[**Creating new issues via email**](https://linear.app/changelog/2019-05-02-creating-new-issues-via-email)\n\n## [Creating new issues via email⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#creating-new-issues-via-email)\n\n![dark mode of mail app](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/2bcdfcbcd5dc589df9581995bc70dd10b9fa02dc-1400x666.jpg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)\n\n**Update: This legacy version of the email integration was updated. Please read the latest [changelog post.](https://linear.app/changelog/2024-02-15-create-issues-via-email)**\n\nThis week we added the ability to create new issues via email. Perfect for when one of your users emails you a bug report. Simply forward it to your team's email address (you can find the correct email address in your team's settings). The subject of the email becomes the issue's title and the body the description.\n\n## [Board enhancements⁠](https://linear.app/changelog/page/21\\#board-enhancements)\n\nBoards received some love this week, too. You can now easily archive all issues in a board column using the column's drop-down menu. Perfect for when you want to archive all completed issues at the end of the week.
